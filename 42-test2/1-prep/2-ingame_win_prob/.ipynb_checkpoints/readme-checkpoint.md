# In-game win probability
Develop an in-game win probability model for NFL games based on the time remaining and score-differential state. To do so,
* Use Bayes Rule and Multinomial Logistic regressions
* Estimate the probability of a possession team win relative to the defensive team
* Estimate the model at the season-game-minute level
* Convert the score-differential into score-differential catagories
